1. I looked up what -> means and it said it was an arrow operator and that it is used to access members of a structure through a pointer. Since l is a pointer to a list, does this mean that l -> display(); would be the same thing as l.display(); in java?

2. At first it confused me that the list was printed backwards before I saw the comment in the display method. Is this the best way to print it or would printing it the right way be viable?
